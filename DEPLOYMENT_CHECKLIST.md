## Deployment Steps

### 1. Backend Deployment

#### Option A: Heroku
```bash
# Install Heroku CLI
# Login to Heroku
heroku login

# Create new app
heroku create your-lms-backend

# Set environment variables
heroku config:set MONGO_URI=your-mongodb-uri
heroku config:set JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
heroku config:set NODE_ENV=production

# Deploy
git push heroku main
```

#### Option B: Railway
```bash
# Connect your GitHub repository
# Set environment variables in Railway dashboard
# Deploy automatically on push
```

#### Option C: Render
```bash
# Connect your GitHub repository
# Set environment variables in Render dashboard
# Deploy automatically on push
```

### 2. Frontend Deployment

#### Option A: Netlify
```bash
# Build the project
cd frontend
npm run build

# Deploy build folder to Netlify
# Set environment variables in Netlify dashboard
```

#### Option B: Vercel
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
cd frontend
vercel

# Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
```

#### Option C: GitHub Pages
```bash
# Add homepage to package.json
"homepage": "https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo"

# Install gh-pages
npm install --save-dev gh-pages

# Add deploy script to package.json
"deploy": "gh-pages -d build"

# Deploy
npm run deploy
```

### 3. Domain Configuration
- [ ] Custom domain purchased (if needed)
- [ ] DNS records configured
- [ ] SSL certificate installed
- [ ] Domain pointing to correct deployment

### 4. Database Setup
- [ ] MongoDB Atlas cluster created (if using cloud)

- [ ] Course creation and management
- [ ] Live class functionality
- [ ] Quiz and assignment system
- [ ] File uploads (if applicable)
- [ ] Real-time features (chat, whiteboard)
- [ ] Payment integration (if applicable)

### âœ… Performance Tests
- [ ] Page load times acceptable
- [ ] API response times under 2 seconds
- [ ] Database queries optimized
- [ ] Images and assets optimized

### âœ… Security Tests
- [ ] Authentication working properly
- [ ] Authorization checks in place
- [ ] Input validation working
- [ ] No sensitive data exposed
- [ ] HTTPS working correctly

### âœ… Mobile Responsiveness
- [ ] Mobile navigation working

- [ ] Security patch process in place
- [ ] Feature update deployment process

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Backend Issues
- **Port already in use**: Change PORT in environment variables
- **MongoDB connection failed**: Check connection string and network access
- **CORS errors**: Verify CORS configuration matches frontend domain
- **JWT errors**: Check JWT_SECRET is set correctly

### Frontend Issues
- **Build failures**: Check for missing dependencies or syntax errors
- **API calls failing**: Verify API base URL is correct
- **Static assets not loading**: Check build output and deployment configuration
- **Routing issues**: Verify React Router configuration

### Database Issues
- **Connection timeouts**: Check network access and connection string
- **Authentication errors**: Verify database user credentials
- **Performance issues**: Check indexes and query optimization

## Emergency Procedures

### Rollback Plan
- [ ] Previous version deployment process documented
- [ ] Database rollback procedures defined
- [ ] Configuration rollback process in place

### Contact Information
- [ ] Hosting provider support contacts
- [ ] Database provider support contacts
- [ ] Domain provider support contacts
- [ ] Development team contacts
